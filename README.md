# LetsSketch - a helping hand for police

LetsSketch is a website which can be used for making facial composites of criminals by selecting various facial features one by one and eventually making the complete sketch.
It can be used in remote areas where sketch artists are not easily available and when victim or witness is dumb.
You can also save the sketches for later use.
