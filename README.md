# LetsSketch - a helping hand for police

LetsSketch is a website which can be used for making facial composites of criminals by selecting various facial features one by one and eventually making the complete sketch. <br/>
It can be used in remote areas where sketch artists are not easily available and when victim or witness is dumb.<br/>
You can also save the sketches for later use.<br/>
